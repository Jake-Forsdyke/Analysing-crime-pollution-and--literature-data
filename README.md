# Analysing-crime-pollution-and--literature-data
Year 3: Analysing data from two books along with the crimes and pollution of a fictional city.
This was an individual project where I analysed feautures in books by Lucy Maud Montgomery such as word frequency.
Using data provided about a fictional city; Utopia. I suggest ways to reduce crime rate and investigate pollution within the area.
